This isn't so much of a precise recipe. I do it based on how I'm feeling.

## Ingredients

* Olive oil
* Cayenne Pepper, usually 4 or more
* Onion 1 or 2
* Oyster Sauce 1 tablespoon
* Salted Herbs, 1 tablespoon
* Garlic (Optional)
* Haskaps (Optional)

## Preparation

Heat the oil in a pan on high heat.

Add the peppers, mine tend to be dried so I crush them.

When the peppers are a little bit roasted, add the minced onions let them get a golden color. When the color is nice, set the heat to low.

Add the oyster sauce and salted herbs and mix it all together.

Add the garlic and half the haskaps. From time to time, flip the ingredients.

You can add the rest of the haskaps later but don't mix those too much so that they retain their shape.

Keep cooking this slowly until you feel like eating.

## Serve

Eat this with some pasta like spaghettini.
