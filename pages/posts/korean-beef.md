One of my favorite recipes. Easy to do, tastes great every time.

## Ingredients

* Rice, 2 Cup
* Ground Beef, 1.8 kg
* Garlic
* Cayenne Pepper
* Ground Ginger, 1/4 Teaspoon
* Brown Sugar, 1/4 Cup
* Soy Sauce, 1/4 Cup
* Sesame Oil, 2 Tablespoon

## Preparation

Start cooking rice.

Cook ground beef, season it with minced garlic, salt and pepper, and cayenne pepper to taste along with 1/4 teaspoon of ground ginger.

On the side, whisk 1/4 cup of brown sugar, 1/4 cup of soy sauce and 2 tablespoon of sesame oil. Pour over beef and let simmer for a few minutes.

Once the beef is ready, pour it on the rice and enjoy. It will make a few meals.

## Improvements

Once you've done the recipe a few times and are comfortable with it, you can add more ingredients such as sweet peppers, carrots, celeries, mushrooms, or anything else you like. You can double the sauce and cook them on the side in it.
